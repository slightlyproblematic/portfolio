                  <strong>Scratch Project:</strong>
                  <br>
                  The first real coding project I ever did, alone or collaboratively,
                  was this project. This project was done for my Computer Science Principles
                  class, which I took in 2018. It took us about three days,
                  from 09/04 - 09/06. In this project, we built a story as well 
                  as a game. I was in charge of building a large portion of the game, as well
                  as explaining what I was doing to my partner. During this whole process
                  I was also learning the language I was coding in, which I was only roughly
                  familiar with at the time. Documentation <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gi8f5Vs0AIjW4nA0LB2YXZbyhx7zjPj3n4d3MqJn1AY/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
