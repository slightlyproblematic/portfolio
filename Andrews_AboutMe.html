                        Hi, my name is Thomas Andrews. I've been working for a few 
                        years now to accomplish my goal of being an electrical engineer.
                        To accomplish this, I plan on taking my fair share of engineering
                        classes whenever I can. I have been around computers all of my life,
                        but only within the last 5 or so years have I been interested in actually
                        <em>learning</em> about them. I have found myself fascinated by 
                        them, and am in the process of learning as much as I can.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am no stranger to the workplace, and have been employed before.
                        I used to work at Anka BHI, during the summer of 2017, as a file clerk.
                        My job throughout the summer was to scan documents I was given 
                        and put them into a digital database. I ran into my share of glitches
                        during that summer- from the database itself breaking, to the
                        hardware malfunctioning. From my past work exploits, I have learned
                        the importance of being able to get into a routine, and being able
                        to break free of it when I need to think critically. I am able
                        to put my nose to the grindstone when needed and just get things done, 
                        but am also able to contribute to the ideas I am working on.
